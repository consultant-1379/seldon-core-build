alt=\"attrs\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n\n*attrs* is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka [dunder methods](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-dunder-methods)).\n[Trusted by NASA](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-achievement) for Mars missions since 2020!\n\nIts main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\n*attrs* would not be possible without our [amazing sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).\nEspecially those generously supporting us at the *The Organization* tier and higher:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n   <a href=\"https://www.variomedia.de/\">\n      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-attrs/attrs/main/.github/sponsors/Variomedia.svg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\"></img>\n   </a>\n\n   <a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-attrs?utm_source=pypi-attrs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo\">\n      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-attrs/attrs/main/.github/sponsors/Tidelift.svg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\"></img>\n   </a>\n\n   <a href=\"https://sentry.io/\">\n      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-attrs/attrs/main/.github/sponsors/Sentry.svg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\"></img>\n   </a>\n\n   <a href=\"https://filepreviews.io/\">\n      <img

consider <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/hynek\">joining them</a> to help make <em>attrs</em>’s maintenance more sustainable!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<!-- teaser-end -->\n\n## Example\n\n*attrs* gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:\n\n<!-- code-begin -->\n\n```pycon\n>>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory\n\n>>> @define\n... class SomeClass:\n...     a_number: int = 42\n...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)\n...\n...     def hard_math(self, another_number):\n...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number\n\n\n>>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\n>>> sc\nSomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])\n\n>>> sc.hard_math(3)\n19\n>>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\nTrue\n>>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])\nTrue\n\n>>> asdict(sc)\n{'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}\n\n>>> SomeClass()\nSomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])\n\n>>> C = make_class(\"C\", [\"a\", \"b\"])\n>>> C(\"foo\", \"bar\")\nC(a='foo', b='bar')\n```\n\nAfter *declaring* your attributes, *attrs* gives you:\n\n- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,\n- a nice human-readable `__repr__`,\n- equality-checking methods,\n- an initializer,\n- and much more,\n\n*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.\n\n**Hate type annotations**!?\nNo problem!\nTypes are entirely **optional** with *attrs*.\nSimply assign `attrs.field()` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types.\n\n---\n\nThis example uses *attrs*'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the *attrs* package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.\nThe classic APIs (`@attr.s`, `attr.ib`, plus their serious-business aliases) and the `attr` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.\n\nPlease check out [*On The Core API Names*](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html) for a more in-depth explanation.\n\n\n## Data Classes\n\nOn the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, `dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/) of *attrs*).\nIn practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.\nFor instance it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), or allows more ways to [plug into the initialization process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization).\n\nFor more details, please refer to our [comparison page](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes).\n\n\n## Project Information\n\n- [**Changelog**](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html)\n-

Release Information\n\n### Backwards-incompatible Changes\n\n- Python 3.6 has been dropped and packaging switched to static package data using [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/).\n  [#993](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/993)\n\n\n### Deprecations\n\n- The support for *zope-interface* via the `attrs.validators.provides` validator is now deprecated and will be removed in, or after, April 2024.\n\n  The presence of a C-based package in our developement dependencies has caused headaches and we're not under the impression it's used a lot.\n\n  Let us know if you're using it and we might publish it as a separate package.\n  [#1120](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1120)\n\n\n### Changes\n\n- `attrs.filters.exclude()` and `attrs.filters.include()` now support the passing of attribute names as strings.\n  [#1068](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1068)\n- `attrs.has()` and `attrs.fields()` now handle generic classes correctly.\n  [#1079](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1079)\n- Fix frozen exception classes when raised within e.g. `contextlib.contextmanager`, which mutates their `__traceback__` attributes.\n  [#1081](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1081)\n- `@frozen` now works with type checkers that implement [PEP-681](https://peps.python.org/pep-0681/) (ex. [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/)).\n  [#1084](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1084)\n- Restored ability to unpickle instances pickled before 22.2.0.\n  [#1085](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1085)\n- `attrs.asdict()`'s and `attrs.astuple()`'s type stubs now accept the `attrs.AttrsInstance` protocol.\n  [#1090](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1090)\n- Fix slots class cellvar updating closure in CPython 3.8+ even when `__code__` introspection is unavailable.\n  [#1092](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1092)\n- `attrs.resolve_types()` can now pass `include_extras` to `typing.get_type_hints()` on Python 3.9+, and does so by default.\n  [#1099](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1099)\n- Added instructions for pull request workflow to `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\n  [#1105](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1105)\n- Added *type* parameter to `attrs.field()` function for use with `attrs.make_class()`.\n\n  Please note that type checkers ignore type metadata passed into `make_class()`, but it can be useful if you're wrapping _attrs_.\n  [#1107](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1107)\n- It is now possible for `attrs.evolve()` (and `attr.evolve()`) to change fields named `inst` if the instance is passed as a positional argument.\n\n  Passing the instance using the `inst` keyword argument is now deprecated and will be removed in, or after, April 2024.\n  [#1117](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1117)\n- `attrs.validators.optional()` now also accepts a tuple of validators (in addition to lists of validators).\n  [#1122](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1122)\n\n\n\n---\n\n[Full changelog](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html)\n",

Here are some numbers.\n\n| Package                                       | Accuracy | Mean per file (ms) | File per sec (est) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |   86 %   |       200 ms       |     5 file/sec     |\n| charset-normalizer                            | **98 %** |     **10 ms**      |    100 file/sec    |\n\n| Package                                       | 99th percentile | 95th percentile | 50th percentile |\n|-----------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n| [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) |     1200 ms     |     287 ms      |      23 ms      |\n| charset-normalizer                            |     100 ms      |      50 ms      |      5 ms       |\n\nChardet's performance on larger file (1MB+) are very poor. Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (eg. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## ✨ Installation\n\nUsing pip:\n\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## 🚀 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

Top-level\n                        JSON WILL be a list.\n  -n, --normalize       Permit to normalize input file. If not set, program\n                        does not write anything.\n  -m, --minimal         Only output the charset detected to STDOUT. Disabling\n                        JSON output.\n  -r, --replace         Replace file when trying to normalize it instead of\n                        creating a new one.\n  -f, --force           Replace file without asking if you are sure, use this\n                        flag with caution.\n  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold THRESHOLD\n                        Define a custom maximum amount of chaos allowed in\n                        decoded content. 0. <= chaos <= 1.\n  --version             Show version information and exit.\n```\n\n```bash\nnormalizer ./data/sample.1.fr.srt\n```\n\n🎉 Since version 1.4.0 the CLI produce easily usable stdout result in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"path\": \"/home/default/projects/charset_normalizer/data/sample.1.fr.srt\",\n    \"encoding\": \"cp1252\",\n    \"encoding_aliases\": [\n        \"1252\",\n        \"windows_1252\"\n    ],\n    \"alternative_encodings\": [\n        \"cp1254\",\n        \"cp1256\",\n        \"cp1258\",\n        \"iso8859_14\",\n        \"iso8859_15\",\n        \"iso8859_16\",\n        \"iso8859_3\",\n        \"iso8859_9\",\n        \"latin_1\",\n        \"mbcs\"\n    ],\n    \"language\": \"French\",\n    \"alphabets\": [\n        \"Basic Latin\",\n        \"Latin-1 Supplement\"\n    ],\n    \"has_sig_or_bom\": false,\n    \"chaos\": 0.149,\n    \"coherence\": 97.152,\n    \"unicode_path\": null,\n    \"is_preferred\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Python\n*Just print out normalized text*\n```python\nfrom charset_normalizer import from_path\n\nresults = from_path('./my_subtitle.srt')\n\nprint(str(results.best()))\n```\n\n*Upgrade your code without effort*\n```python\nfrom charset_normalizer import detect\n```\n\nThe above code will behave the same as **chardet**. We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## 😇 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can. \n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## 🍰 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess.\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## ⚡ Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## 👤 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## 💼 For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

Our goal is for it to be your \"cryptographic\nstandard library\". It supports Python 3.6+ and PyPy3 7.2+.\n\n``cryptography`` includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to\ncommon cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and\nkey derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with\n``cryptography``'s high level symmetric encryption recipe:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n    >>> # Put this somewhere safe!\n    >>> key = Fernet.generate_key()\n    >>> f = Fernet(key)\n    >>> token = f.encrypt(b\"A really secret message.

Not for prying eyes.'\n\nYou can find more information in the `documentation`_.\n\nYou can install ``cryptography`` with:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install cryptography\n\nFor full details see `the installation documentation`_.\n\nDiscussion\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you run into bugs, you can file them in our `issue tracker`_.\n\nWe maintain a `cryptography-dev`_ mailing list for development discussion.\n\nYou can also join ``#cryptography-dev`` on Freenode to ask questions or get\ninvolved.\n\nSecurity\n~~~~~~~~\n\nNeed to report a security issue?

      "description": "#################\nFlask-OpenTracing\n#################\n\nThis package enables distributed tracing in Flask applications via `The OpenTracing Project`_. Once a production system contends with real concurrency or splits into many services, crucial (and formerly easy) tasks become difficult: user-facing latency optimization, root-cause analysis of backend errors, communication about distinct pieces of a now-distributed system, etc. Distributed tracing follows a request on its journey from inception to completion from mobile/browser all the way to the microservices. \n\nAs core services and libraries adopt OpenTracing, the application builder is no longer burdened with the task of adding basic tracing instrumentation to their own code. In this way, developers can build their applications with the tools they prefer and benefit from built-in tracing instrumentation. OpenTracing implementations exist for major distributed tracing systems and can be bound or swapped with a one-line configuration change.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the underlying python API, visit the python `source code`_.\n\nIf you are migrating from the 0.x series, you may want to read the list of `breaking changes`_.\n\n.. _The OpenTracing Project: http://opentracing.io/\n.. _source code: https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-python\n.. _breaking changes: #breaking-changes-from-0-x\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nRun the following command:\n\n.. code-block:: \n\n    $ pip install Flask-Opentracing\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis Flask extension allows for tracing of Flask apps using the OpenTracing API. All\nthat it requires is for a ``FlaskTracing`` tracer to be initialized using an\ninstance of an OpenTracing tracer. You can either trace all requests to your site, or use function decorators to trace certain individual requests.\n\n**Note:** `optional_args` in both cases are any number of attributes (as strings) of `flask.Request` that you wish to set as tags on the created span\n\nInitialize\n----------\n\n`FlaskTracing` wraps the tracer instance that's supported by opentracing. To create a `FlaskTracing` object, you can either pass in a tracer object directly or a callable that returns the tracer object. For example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import opentracing\n    from flask_opentracing import FlaskTracing\n\n    opentracing_tracer = ## some OpenTracing tracer implementation\n    tracing = FlaskTracing(opentracing_tracer, ...)\n\nor\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import opentracing\n    from flask_opentracing import FlaskTracing\n\n    def initialize_tracer():\n        ...\n        return opentracing_tracer\n\n    tracing = FlaskTracing(initialize_tracer, ...)\n\n\nTrace All Requests\n------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import opentracing\n    from flask_opentracing import FlaskTracing\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    opentracing_tracer = ## some OpenTracing tracer implementation\n    tracing = FlaskTracing(opentracing_tracer, True, app, [optional_args])\n\nTrace Individual Requests\n-------------------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import opentracing\n    from flask_opentracing import FlaskTracing\n\n    app = Flask(__name__)\n\n    opentracing_tracer = ## some OpenTracing tracer implementation  \n    tracing = FlaskTracing(opentracing_tracer)\n\n    @app.route('/some_url')\n    @tracing.trace(optional_args)\n    def some_view_func():\n    \t...     \n    \treturn some_view \n\nAccessing Spans Manually\n------------------------\n\nIn order to access the span for a request, we've provided an method `FlaskTracing.get_span(request)` that returns the span for the request, if it is exists and is not finished. This can be used to log important events to the span, set tags, or create child spans to trace non-RPC events. If no request is passed in, the current request will be used.\n\nTracing an RPC\n--------------\n\nIf you want to make an RPC and continue an existing trace, you can inject the current span into the RPC. For example, if making an http request, the following code will continue your trace across the wire:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    @tracing.trace()\n    def some_view_func(request):\n        new_request = some_http_request\n        current_span = tracing.get_span(request)\n        text_carrier = {}\n        opentracing_tracer.inject(span, opentracing.Format.TEXT_MAP, text_carrier)\n        for k, v in text_carrier.iteritems():\n            new_request.add_header(k,v)\n        ... # make request\n\nExamples\n========\n\nSee `examples`_ to view and run an example of two Flask applications\nwith integrated OpenTracing tracers.\n\n.. _examples: https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/python-flask/tree/master/example\n\n`This tutorial <http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2018/01/15/tutorial-tracing-python-flask-requests-with-opentracing>`_ has a step-by-step guide for using `Flask-Opentracing` with `Jaeger <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger>`_.\n\nBreaking changes from 0.x\n=========================\n\nStarting with the 1.0 version, a few changes have taken place from previous versions:\n\n* ``FlaskTracer`` has been renamed to ``FlaskTracing``, although ``FlaskTracing``\n  can be used still as a deprecated name.\n* When passing an ``Application`` object at ``FlaskTracing`` creation time,\n  ``trace_all_requests`` defaults to ``True``.\n* When no ``opentracing.Tracer`` is provided, ``FlaskTracing`` will rely on the\n  global tracer.\n\nFurther Information\n===================\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the OpenTracing standard, please visit `opentracing.io`_ or `join the mailing list`_. If you would like to implement OpenTracing in your project and need help, feel free to send us a note at `community@opentracing.io`_.\n\n.. _opentracing.io: http://opentracing.io/\n.. _join the mailing list: http://opentracing.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=180afe03860541dae59e84153&id=19117aa6cd\n.. _community@opentracing.io: community@opentracing.io",

On Windows and on Mac OS X one *must* have a recent release of :code:`pip`\nto retrieve the proper wheel from PyPI. Be sure to upgrade to the latest\nversion!\n\nInstalling From Source\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBuilding from source requires that you have the Python headers (usually a\npackage named :code:`python-dev`).\n\n::\n\n  $ export REPO_ROOT=grpc  # REPO_ROOT can be any directory of your choice\n  $ git clone -b RELEASE_TAG_HERE https://github.com/grpc/grpc $REPO_ROOT\n  $ cd $REPO_ROOT\n  $ git submodule update --init\n\n  # For the next two commands do `sudo pip install` if you get permission-denied errors\n  $ pip install -rrequirements.txt\n  $ GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_WITH_CYTHON=1 pip install .\n\nYou cannot currently install Python from source on Windows. Things might work\nout for you in MSYS2 (follow the Linux instructions), but it isn't officially\nsupported at the moment.\n\nTroubleshooting\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHelp, I ...\n\n* **... see a** :code:`pkg_resources.VersionConflict` **when I try to install\n  grpc**\n\n  This is likely because :code:`pip` doesn't own the offending dependency,\n  which in turn is likely because your operating system's package manager owns\n  it. You'll need to force the installation of the dependency:\n\n  :code:`pip install --ignore-installed $OFFENDING_DEPENDENCY`\n\n  For example, if you get an error like the following:\n\n  ::\n\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<string>\", line 17, in <module>\n     ...\n    File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 509, in find\n      raise VersionConflict(dist, req)\n    pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (six 1.8.0 (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('six>=1.10'))\n\n  You can fix it by doing:\n\n  ::\n\n    sudo pip install --ignore-installed six\n\n* **... see the following error on some platforms**\n\n  ::\n\n    /tmp/pip-build-U8pSsr/cython/Cython/Plex/Scanners.c:4:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\n    #include \"Python.h\"\n                    ^\n    compilation terminated.\n\n  You can fix it by installing `python-dev` package. i.e\n\n  ::\n\n    sudo apt-get install python-dev\n\n\n\n",

Grants\n      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n      2.2. Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.",

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\ndistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\nLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\npermitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\napplicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\nequivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2.

License Grants and Conditions\n      2.1. Grants\n      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n      2.2. Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.",

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

It's a pre-fork\nworker model ported from Ruby's Unicorn_ project. The Gunicorn server is broadly\ncompatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server\nresource usage, and fairly speedy.\n\nFeel free to join us in `#gunicorn`_ on `Libera.chat`_.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation is hosted at https://docs.gunicorn.org.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nGunicorn requires **Python 3.x >= 3.5**.\n\nInstall from PyPI::\n\n    $ pip install gunicorn\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nBasic usage::\n\n    $ gunicorn [OPTIONS] APP_MODULE\n\nWhere ``APP_MODULE`` is of the pattern ``$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)``. The\nmodule name can be a full dotted path. The variable name refers to a WSGI\ncallable that should be found in the specified module.\n\nExample with test app::\n\n    $ cd examples\n    $ gunicorn --workers=2 test:app\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSee `our complete contributor's guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for more details.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nGunicorn is released under the MIT License.

      "description": "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\n=====================================================\n\nSupport for the Internationalized Domain Names in\nApplications (IDNA) protocol as specified in `RFC 5891\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_. This is the latest version of\nthe protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”.\n\nThis library also provides support for Unicode Technical\nStandard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThis acts as a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports the older superseded IDNA specification (`RFC 3490\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3490>`_).\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to A-labels or U-labels\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nYou may use the codec encoding and decoding methods using the\n``idna.codec`` module:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna.codec\n    >>> print('домен.испытание'.encode('idna'))\n    b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'\n    >>> print(b'xn--d1acufc.xn--80akhbyknj4f'.decode('idna'))\n    домен.испытание\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAs described in `RFC 5895 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, the\nIDNA specification does not normalize input from different potential\nways a user may input a domain name. This functionality, known as\na “mapping”, is considered by the specification to be a local\nuser-interface issue distinct from IDNA conversion functionality.\n\nThis library provides one such mapping, that was developed by the\nUnicode Consortium. Known as `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_, it provides for both a regular\nmapping for typical applications, as well as a transitional mapping to\nhelp migrate from older IDNA 2003 applications.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\nTransitional processing provides conversions to help transition from\nthe older 2003 standard to the current standard. For example, in the\noriginal IDNA specification, the *LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S* (ß) was\nconverted into two *LATIN SMALL LETTER S* (ss), whereas in the current\nIDNA specification this conversion is not performed.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True, transitional=True)\n    'xn--knigsgsschen-lcb0w'\n\nImplementors should use transitional processing with caution, only in\nrare cases where conversion from legacy labels to current labels must be\nperformed (i.e. IDNA implementations that pre-date 2008). For typical\napplications that just need to convert labels, transitional processing\nis unlikely to be beneficial and could produce unexpected incompatible\nresults.\n\n``encodings.idna`` Compatibility\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nFunction calls from the Python built-in ``encodings.idna`` module are\nmapped to their IDNA 2008 equivalents using the ``idna.compat`` module.\nSimply substitute the ``import`` clause in your code to refer to the new\nmodule name.\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its positional context (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards. These tables are\ncomputed using the command-line script ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables using for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementors who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to use in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.5 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older intepreter support.\n  Removing support for older versions should be well justified in that the\n  maintenance burden has become too high.\n\n* **Python 2**. Python 2 is supported by version 2.x of this library.\n  While active development of the version 2.x series has ended, notable\n  issues being corrected may be backported to 2.x. Use \"idna<3\" in your\n  requirements file if you need this library for a Python 2 application.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that wish need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n",

      "description": "\nOpenTracing API for Python\n==========================\n\n|GitterChat| |BuildStatus| |PyPI| |ReadTheDocs|\n\nThis library is a Python platform API for OpenTracing.\n\nRequired Reading\n----------------\n\nIn order to understand the Python platform API, one must first be familiar with\nthe `OpenTracing project <http://opentracing.io>`_ and\n`terminology <http://opentracing.io/documentation/pages/spec.html>`_ more\nspecifically.\n\nStatus\n------\n\nIn the current version, ``opentracing-python`` provides only the API and a\nbasic no-op implementation that can be used by instrumentation libraries to\ncollect and propagate distributed tracing context.\n\nFuture versions will include a reference implementation utilizing an\nabstract Recorder interface, as well as a\n`Zipkin <http://openzipkin.github.io>`_-compatible Tracer.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe work of instrumentation libraries generally consists of three steps:\n\n1. When a service receives a new request (over HTTP or some other protocol),\n   it uses OpenTracing's inject/extract API to continue an active trace, creating a\n   Span object in the process. If the request does not contain an active trace,\n   the service starts a new trace and a new *root* Span.\n2. The service needs to store the current Span in some request-local storage,\n   (called ``Span`` *activation*) where it can be retrieved from when a child Span must\n   be created, e.g. in case of the service making an RPC to another service.\n3. When making outbound calls to another service, the current Span must be\n   retrieved from request-local storage, a child span must be created (e.g., by\n   using the ``start_child_span()`` helper), and that child span must be embedded\n   into the outbound request (e.g., using HTTP headers) via OpenTracing's\n   inject/extract API.\n\nBelow are the code examples for the previously mentioned steps. Implementation\nof request-local storage needed for step 2 is specific to the service and/or frameworks /\ninstrumentation libraries it is using, exposed as a ``ScopeManager`` child contained\nas ``Tracer.scope_manager``. See details below.\n\nInbound request\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nSomewhere in your server's request handler code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   def handle_request(request):\n       span = before_request(request, opentracing.global_tracer())\n       # store span in some request-local storage using Tracer.scope_manager,\n       # using the returned `Scope` as Context Manager to ensure\n       # `Span` will be cleared and (in this case) `Span.finish()` be called.\n       with tracer.scope_manager.activate(span, True) as scope:\n           # actual business logic\n           handle_request_for_real(request)\n\n\n   def before_request(request, tracer):\n       span_context = tracer.extract(\n           format=Format.HTTP_HEADERS,\n           carrier=request.headers,\n       )\n       span = tracer.start_span(\n           operation_name=request.operation,\n           child_of=span_context)\n       span.set_tag('http.url', request.full_url)\n\n       remote_ip = request.remote_ip\n       if remote_ip:\n           span.set_tag(tags.PEER_HOST_IPV4, remote_ip)\n\n       caller_name = request.caller_name\n       if caller_name:\n           span.set_tag(tags.PEER_SERVICE, caller_name)\n\n       remote_port = request.remote_port\n       if remote_port:\n           span.set_tag(tags.PEER_PORT, remote_port)\n\n       return span\n\nOutbound request\n----------------\n\nSomewhere in your service that's about to make an outgoing call:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   from opentracing import tags\n   from opentracing.propagation import Format\n   from opentracing_instrumentation import request_context\n\n   # create and serialize a child span and use it as context manager\n   with before_http_request(\n       request=out_request,\n       current_span_extractor=request_context.get_current_span):\n\n       # actual call\n       return urllib2.urlopen(request)\n\n\n   def before_http_request(request, current_span_extractor):\n       op = request.operation\n       parent_span = current_span_extractor()\n       outbound_span = opentracing.global_tracer().start_span(\n           operation_name=op,\n           child_of=parent_span\n       )\n\n       outbound_span.set_tag('http.url', request.full_url)\n       service_name = request.service_name\n       host, port = request.host_port\n       if service_name:\n           outbound_span.set_tag(tags.PEER_SERVICE, service_name)\n       if host:\n           outbound_span.set_tag(tags.PEER_HOST_IPV4, host)\n       if port:\n           outbound_span.set_tag(tags.PEER_PORT, port)\n\n       http_header_carrier = {}\n       opentracing.global_tracer().inject(\n           span_context=outbound_span,\n           format=Format.HTTP_HEADERS,\n           carrier=http_header_carrier)\n\n       for key, value in http_header_carrier.iteritems():\n           request.add_header(key, value)\n\n       return outbound_span\n\nScope and within-process propagation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFor getting/setting the current active ``Span`` in the used request-local storage,\nOpenTracing requires that every ``Tracer`` contains a ``ScopeManager`` that grants\naccess to the active ``Span`` through a ``Scope``. Any ``Span`` may be transferred to\nanother task or thread, but not ``Scope``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n       # Access to the active span is straightforward.\n       scope = tracer.scope_manager.active()\n       if scope is not None:\n           scope.span.set_tag('...', '...')\n\nThe common case starts a ``Scope`` that's automatically registered for intra-process\npropagation via ``ScopeManager``.\n\nNote that ``start_active_span('...')`` automatically finishes the span on ``Scope.close()``\n(``start_active_span('...', finish_on_close=False)`` does not finish it, in contrast).\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n       # Manual activation of the Span.\n       span = tracer.start_span(operation_name='someWork')\n       with tracer.scope_manager.activate(span, True) as scope:\n           # Do things.\n\n       # Automatic activation of the Span.\n       # finish_on_close is a required parameter.\n       with tracer.start_active_span('someWork', finish_on_close=True) as scope:\n           # Do things.\n\n       # Handling done through a try construct:\n       span = tracer.start_span(operation_name='someWork')\n       scope = tracer.scope_manager.activate(span, True)\n       try:\n           # Do things.\n       except Exception as e:\n           span.set_tag('error', '...')\n       finally:\n           scope.close()\n\n**If there is a Scope, it will act as the parent to any newly started Span** unless\nthe programmer passes ``ignore_active_span=True`` at ``start_span()``/``start_active_span()``\ntime or specified parent context explicitly:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n       scope = tracer.start_active_span('someWork', ignore_active_span=True)\n\nEach service/framework ought to provide a specific ``ScopeManager`` implementation\nthat relies on their own request-local storage (thread-local storage, or coroutine-based storage\nfor asynchronous frameworks, for example).\n\nScope managers\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis project includes a set of ``ScopeManager`` implementations under the ``opentracing.scope_managers`` submodule, which can be imported on demand:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   from opentracing.scope_managers import ThreadLocalScopeManager\n\nThere exist implementations for ``thread-local`` (the default instance of the submodule ``opentracing.scope_managers``), ``gevent``, ``Tornado``, ``asyncio`` and ``contextvars``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   from opentracing.scope_managers.gevent import GeventScopeManager # requires gevent\n   from opentracing.scope_managers.tornado import TornadoScopeManager # requires tornado<6\n   from opentracing.scope_managers.asyncio import AsyncioScopeManager # fits for old asyncio applications, requires Python 3.4 or newer.\n   from opentracing.scope_managers.contextvars import ContextVarsScopeManager # for asyncio applications, requires Python 3.7 or newer.\n\n\n**Note** that for asyncio applications it's preferable to use ``ContextVarsScopeManager`` instead of ``AsyncioScopeManager`` because of automatic parent span propagation to children coroutines, tasks or scheduled callbacks.\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nTests\n^^^^^\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n   virtualenv env\n   . ./env/bin/activate\n   make bootstrap\n   make test\n\nYou can use `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io>`_ to run tests as well.\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    tox\n\nTestbed suite\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nA testbed suite designed to test API changes and experimental features is included under the *testbed* directory. For more information, see the `Testbed README <testbed/README.md>`_.\n\nInstrumentation Tests\n---------------------\n\nThis project has a working design of interfaces for the OpenTracing API. There is a MockTracer to\nfacilitate unit-testing of OpenTracing Python instrumentation.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n       from opentracing.mocktracer import MockTracer\n\n       tracer = MockTracer()\n       with tracer.start_span('someWork') as span:\n           pass\n\n       spans = tracer.finished_spans()\n       someWorkSpan = spans[0]\n\n\nDocumentation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n   virtualenv env\n   . ./env/bin/activate\n   make bootstrap\n   make docs\n\nThe documentation is written to *docs/_build/html*.\n\nLICENSE\n^^^^^^^\n\n`Apache 2.0 License <./LICENSE>`__.\n\nReleases\n^^^^^^^^\n\nBefore new release, add a summary of changes since last version to CHANGELOG.rst\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n   pip install zest.releaser[recommended]\n   prerelease\n   release\n   git push origin master --follow-tags\n   python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi upload_docs -r pypi\n   postrelease\n   git push\n\n.. |GitterChat| image:: http://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-join%20chat%20%E2%86%92-brightgreen.svg\n   :target: https://gitter.im/opentracing/public\n.. |BuildStatus| image:: https://travis-ci.org/opentracing/opentracing-python.svg?branch-master\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/opentracing/opentracing-python\n.. |PyPI| image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/opentracing.svg\n   :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/opentracing\n.. |ReadTheDocs| image:: http://readthedocs.org/projects/opentracing-python/badge/?version=latest\n   :target: https://opentracing-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n",

      "description": "# Prometheus Python Client\n\nThe official Python client for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).\n\n## Three Step Demo\n\n**One**: Install the client:\n```\npip install prometheus-client\n```\n\n**Two**: Paste the following into a Python interpreter:\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary\nimport random\nimport time\n\n# Create a metric to track time spent and requests made.\nREQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')\n\n# Decorate function with metric.\n@REQUEST_TIME.time()\ndef process_request(t):\n    \"\"\"A dummy function that takes some time.\"\"\"\n    time.sleep(t)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Start up the server to expose the metrics.\n    start_http_server(8000)\n    # Generate some requests.\n    while True:\n        process_request(random.random())\n```\n\n**Three**: Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to view the metrics.\n\nFrom one easy to use decorator you get:\n  * `request_processing_seconds_count`: Number of times this function was called.\n  * `request_processing_seconds_sum`: Total amount of time spent in this function.\n\nPrometheus's `rate` function allows calculation of both requests per second,\nand latency over time from this data.\n\nIn addition if you're on Linux the `process` metrics expose CPU, memory and\nother information about the process for free!\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install prometheus-client\n```\n\nThis package can be found on\n[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/prometheus_client).\n\n## Instrumenting\n\nFour types of metric are offered: Counter, Gauge, Summary and Histogram.\nSee the documentation on [metric types](http://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/)\nand [instrumentation best practices](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/#counter-vs-gauge-summary-vs-histogram)\non how to use them.\n\n### Counter\n\nCounters go up, and reset when the process restarts.\n\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Counter\nc = Counter('my_failures', 'Description of counter')\nc.inc()     # Increment by 1\nc.inc(1.6)  # Increment by given value\n```\n\nIf there is a suffix of `_total` on the metric name, it will be removed. When\nexposing the time series for counter, a `_total` suffix will be added. This is\nfor compatibility between OpenMetrics and the Prometheus text format, as OpenMetrics\nrequires the `_total` suffix.\n\nThere are utilities to count exceptions raised:\n\n```python\n@c.count_exceptions()\ndef f():\n  pass\n\nwith c.count_exceptions():\n  pass\n\n# Count only one type of exception\nwith c.count_exceptions(ValueError):\n  pass\n```\n\n### Gauge\n\nGauges can go up and down.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Gauge\ng = Gauge('my_inprogress_requests', 'Description of gauge')\ng.inc()      # Increment by 1\ng.dec(10)    # Decrement by given value\ng.set(4.2)   # Set to a given value\n```\n\nThere are utilities for common use cases:\n\n```python\ng.set_to_current_time()   # Set to current unixtime\n\n# Increment when entered, decrement when exited.\n@g.track_inprogress()\ndef f():\n  pass\n\nwith g.track_inprogress():\n  pass\n```\n\nA Gauge can also take its value from a callback:\n\n```python\nd = Gauge('data_objects', 'Number of objects')\nmy_dict = {}\nd.set_function(lambda: len(my_dict))\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nSummaries track the size and number of events.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Summary\ns = Summary('request_latency_seconds', 'Description of summary')\ns.observe(4.7)    # Observe 4.7 (seconds in this case)\n```\n\nThere are utilities for timing code:\n\n```python\n@s.time()\ndef f():\n  pass\n\nwith s.time():\n  pass\n```\n\nThe Python client doesn't store or expose quantile information at this time.\n\n### Histogram\n\nHistograms track the size and number of events in buckets.\nThis allows for aggregatable calculation of quantiles.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Histogram\nh = Histogram('request_latency_seconds', 'Description of histogram')\nh.observe(4.7)    # Observe 4.7 (seconds in this case)\n```\n\nThe default buckets are intended to cover a typical web/rpc request from milliseconds to seconds.\nThey can be overridden by passing `buckets` keyword argument to `Histogram`.\n\nThere are utilities for timing code:\n\n```python\n@h.time()\ndef f():\n  pass\n\nwith h.time():\n  pass\n```\n\n### Info\n\nInfo tracks key-value information, usually about a whole target.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Info\ni = Info('my_build_version', 'Description of info')\ni.info({'version': '1.2.3', 'buildhost': 'foo@bar'})\n```\n\n### Enum\n\nEnum tracks which of a set of states something is currently in.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Enum\ne = Enum('my_task_state', 'Description of enum',\n        states=['starting', 'running', 'stopped'])\ne.state('running')\n```\n\n### Labels\n\nAll metrics can have labels, allowing grouping of related time series.\n\nSee the best practices on [naming](http://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/)\nand [labels](http://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/#use-labels).\n\nTaking a counter as an example:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Counter\nc = Counter('my_requests_total', 'HTTP Failures', ['method', 'endpoint'])\nc.labels('get', '/').inc()\nc.labels('post', '/submit').inc()\n```\n\nLabels can also be passed as keyword-arguments:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Counter\nc = Counter('my_requests_total', 'HTTP Failures', ['method', 'endpoint'])\nc.labels(method='get', endpoint='/').inc()\nc.labels(method='post', endpoint='/submit').inc()\n```\n\nMetrics with labels are not initialized when declared, because the client can't\nknow what values the label can have. It is recommended to initialize the label\nvalues by calling the `.labels()` method alone:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Counter\nc = Counter('my_requests_total', 'HTTP Failures', ['method', 'endpoint'])\nc.labels('get', '/')\nc.labels('post', '/submit')\n```\n\n### Exemplars\n\nExemplars can be added to counter and histogram metrics. Exemplars can be\nspecified by passing a dict of label value pairs to be exposed as the exemplar.\nFor example with a counter:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Counter\nc = Counter('my_requests_total', 'HTTP Failures', ['method', 'endpoint'])\nc.labels('get', '/').inc(exemplar={'trace_id': 'abc123'})\nc.labels('post', '/submit').inc(1.0, {'trace_id': 'def456'})\n```\n\nAnd with a histogram:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Histogram\nh = Histogram('request_latency_seconds', 'Description of histogram')\nh.observe(4.7, {'trace_id': 'abc123'})\n```\n\n### Disabling `_created` metrics\n\nBy default counters, histograms, and summaries export an additional series\nsuffixed with `_created` and a value of the unix timestamp for when the metric\nwas created. If this information is not helpful, it can be disabled by setting\nthe environment variable `PROMETHEUS_DISABLE_CREATED_SERIES=True`.\n\n### Process Collector\n\nThe Python client automatically exports metrics about process CPU usage, RAM,\nfile descriptors and start time. These all have the prefix `process`, and\nare only currently available on Linux.\n\nThe namespace and pid constructor arguments allows for exporting metrics about\nother processes, for example:\n```\nProcessCollector(namespace='mydaemon', pid=lambda: open('/var/run/daemon.pid').read())\n```\n\n### Platform Collector\n\nThe client also automatically exports some metadata about Python. If using Jython,\nmetadata about the JVM in use is also included. This information is available as \nlabels on the `python_info` metric. The value of the metric is 1, since it is the \nlabels that carry information.\n\n### Disabling Default Collector metrics\n\nBy default the collected `process`, `gc`, and `platform` collector metrics are exported.\nIf this information is not helpful, it can be disabled using the following:\n```python\nimport prometheus_client\n\nprometheus_client.REGISTRY.unregister(prometheus_client.GC_COLLECTOR)\nprometheus_client.REGISTRY.unregister(prometheus_client.PLATFORM_COLLECTOR)\nprometheus_client.REGISTRY.unregister(prometheus_client.PROCESS_COLLECTOR)\n```\n\n## Exporting\n\nThere are several options for exporting metrics.\n\n### HTTP\n\nMetrics are usually exposed over HTTP, to be read by the Prometheus server.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is via `start_http_server`, which will start a HTTP\nserver in a daemon thread on the given port:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import start_http_server\n\nstart_http_server(8000)\n```\n\nVisit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to view the metrics.\n\nTo add Prometheus exposition to an existing HTTP server, see the `MetricsHandler` class\nwhich provides a `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`. It also serves as a simple example of how\nto write a custom endpoint.\n\n#### Twisted\n\nTo use prometheus with [twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/), there is `MetricsResource` which exposes metrics as a twisted resource.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client.twisted import MetricsResource\nfrom twisted.web.server import Site\nfrom twisted.web.resource import Resource\nfrom twisted.internet import reactor\n\nroot = Resource()\nroot.putChild(b'metrics', MetricsResource())\n\nfactory = Site(root)\nreactor.listenTCP(8000, factory)\nreactor.run()\n```\n\n#### WSGI\n\nTo use Prometheus with [WSGI](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), there is\n`make_wsgi_app` which creates a WSGI application.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import make_wsgi_app\nfrom wsgiref.simple_server import make_server\n\napp = make_wsgi_app()\nhttpd = make_server('', 8000, app)\nhttpd.serve_forever()\n```\n\nSuch an application can be useful when integrating Prometheus metrics with WSGI\napps.\n\nThe method `start_wsgi_server` can be used to serve the metrics through the\nWSGI reference implementation in a new thread.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import start_wsgi_server\n\nstart_wsgi_server(8000)\n```\n\nBy default, the WSGI application will respect `Accept-Encoding:gzip` headers used by Prometheus\nand compress the response if such a header is present. This behaviour can be disabled by passing\n`disable_compression=True` when creating the app, like this:\n\n```python\napp = make_wsgi_app(disable_compression=True)\n```\n\n#### ASGI\n\nTo use Prometheus with [ASGI](http://asgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), there is\n`make_asgi_app` which creates an ASGI application.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import make_asgi_app\n\napp = make_asgi_app()\n```\nSuch an application can be useful when integrating Prometheus metrics with ASGI\napps.\n\nBy default, the WSGI application will respect `Accept-Encoding:gzip` headers used by Prometheus\nand compress the response if such a header is present. This behaviour can be disabled by passing \n`disable_compression=True` when creating the app, like this:\n\n```python\napp = make_asgi_app(disable_compression=True)\n```\n\n#### Flask\n\nTo use Prometheus with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) we need to serve metrics through a Prometheus WSGI application. This can be achieved using [Flask's application dispatching](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/patterns/appdispatch/). Below is a working example.\n\nSave the snippet below in a `myapp.py` file\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom werkzeug.middleware.dispatcher import DispatcherMiddleware\nfrom prometheus_client import make_wsgi_app\n\n# Create my app\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Add prometheus wsgi middleware to route /metrics requests\napp.wsgi_app = DispatcherMiddleware(app.wsgi_app, {\n    '/metrics': make_wsgi_app()\n})\n```\n\nRun the example web application like this\n\n```bash\n# Install uwsgi if you do not have it\npip install uwsgi\nuwsgi --http 127.0.0.1:8000 --wsgi-file myapp.py --callable app\n```\n\nVisit http://localhost:8000/metrics to see the metrics\n\n#### FastAPI + Gunicorn\n\nTo use Prometheus with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) we need to serve metrics through a Prometheus ASGI application.\n\nSave the snippet below in a `myapp.py` file\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom prometheus_client import make_asgi_app\n\n# Create app\napp = FastAPI(debug=False)\n\n# Add prometheus asgi middleware to route /metrics requests\nmetrics_app = make_asgi_app()\napp.mount(\"/metrics\", metrics_app)\n```\n\nFor Multiprocessing support, use this modified code snippet. Full multiprocessing instructions are provided [here](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python#multiprocess-mode-eg-gunicorn).\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom prometheus_client import make_asgi_app\n\napp = FastAPI(debug=False)\n\n# Using multiprocess collector for registry\ndef make_metrics_app():\n    registry = CollectorRegistry()\n    multiprocess.MultiProcessCollector(registry)\n    return make_asgi_app(registry=registry)\n\n\nmetrics_app = make_metrics_app()\napp.mount(\"/metrics\", metrics_app)\n```\n\nRun the example web application like this\n\n```bash\n# Install gunicorn if you do not have it\npip install gunicorn\n# If using multiple workers, add `--workers n` parameter to the line below\ngunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8000 myapp:app -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker\n```\n\nVisit http://localhost:8000/metrics to see the metrics\n\n\n### Node exporter textfile collector\n\nThe [textfile collector](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#textfile-collector)\nallows machine-level statistics to be exported out via the Node exporter.\n\nThis is useful for monitoring cronjobs, or for writing cronjobs to expose metrics\nabout a machine system that the Node exporter does not support or would not make sense\nto perform at every scrape (for example, anything involving subprocesses).\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, write_to_textfile\n\nregistry = CollectorRegistry()\ng = Gauge('raid_status', '1 if raid array is okay', registry=registry)\ng.set(1)\nwrite_to_textfile('/configured/textfile/path/raid.prom', registry)\n```\n\nA separate registry is used, as the default registry may contain other metrics\nsuch as those from the Process Collector.\n\n## Exporting to a Pushgateway\n\nThe [Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway)\nallows ephemeral and batch jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, push_to_gateway\n\nregistry = CollectorRegistry()\ng = Gauge('job_last_success_unixtime', 'Last time a batch job successfully finished', registry=registry)\ng.set_to_current_time()\npush_to_gateway('localhost:9091', job='batchA', registry=registry)\n```\n\nA separate registry is used, as the default registry may contain other metrics\nsuch as those from the Process Collector.\n\nPushgateway functions take a grouping key. `push_to_gateway` replaces metrics\nwith the same grouping key, `pushadd_to_gateway` only replaces metrics with the\nsame name and grouping key and `delete_from_gateway` deletes metrics with the\ngiven job and grouping key. See the\n[Pushgateway documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/blob/master/README.md)\nfor more information.\n\n`instance_ip_grouping_key` returns a grouping key with the instance label set\nto the host's IP address.\n\n### Handlers for authentication\n\nIf the push gateway you are connecting to is protected with HTTP Basic Auth,\nyou can use a special handler to set the Authorization header.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, push_to_gateway\nfrom prometheus_client.exposition import basic_auth_handler\n\ndef my_auth_handler(url, method, timeout, headers, data):\n    username = 'foobar'\n    password = 'secret123'\n    return basic_auth_handler(url, method, timeout, headers, data, username, password)\nregistry = CollectorRegistry()\ng = Gauge('job_last_success_unixtime', 'Last time a batch job successfully finished', registry=registry)\ng.set_to_current_time()\npush_to_gateway('localhost:9091', job='batchA', registry=registry, handler=my_auth_handler)\n```\n\nTLS Auth is also supported when using the push gateway with a special handler.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, push_to_gateway\nfrom prometheus_client.exposition import tls_auth_handler\n\n\ndef my_auth_handler(url, method, timeout, headers, data):\n    certfile = 'client-crt.pem'\n    keyfile = 'client-key.pem'\n    return tls_auth_handler(url, method, timeout, headers, data, certfile, keyfile)\n\nregistry = CollectorRegistry()\ng = Gauge('job_last_success_unixtime', 'Last time a batch job successfully finished', registry=registry)\ng.set_to_current_time()\npush_to_gateway('localhost:9091', job='batchA', registry=registry, handler=my_auth_handler)\n```\n\n## Bridges\n\nIt is also possible to expose metrics to systems other than Prometheus.\nThis allows you to take advantage of Prometheus instrumentation even\nif you are not quite ready to fully transition to Prometheus yet.\n\n### Graphite\n\nMetrics are pushed over TCP in the Graphite plaintext format.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client.bridge.graphite import GraphiteBridge\n\ngb = GraphiteBridge(('graphite.your.org', 2003))\n# Push once.\ngb.push()\n# Push every 10 seconds in a daemon thread.\ngb.start(10.0)\n```\n\nGraphite [tags](https://grafana.com/blog/2018/01/11/graphite-1.1-teaching-an-old-dog-new-tricks/) are also supported.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client.bridge.graphite import GraphiteBridge\n\ngb = GraphiteBridge(('graphite.your.org', 2003), tags=True)\nc = Counter('my_requests_total', 'HTTP Failures', ['method', 'endpoint'])\nc.labels('get', '/').inc()\ngb.push()\n```\n\n## Custom Collectors\n\nSometimes it is not possible to directly instrument code, as it is not\nin your control. This requires you to proxy metrics from other systems.\n\nTo do so you need to create a custom collector, for example:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client.core import GaugeMetricFamily, CounterMetricFamily, REGISTRY\n\nclass CustomCollector(object):\n    def collect(self):\n        yield GaugeMetricFamily('my_gauge', 'Help text', value=7)\n        c = CounterMetricFamily('my_counter_total', 'Help text', labels=['foo'])\n        c.add_metric(['bar'], 1.7)\n        c.add_metric(['baz'], 3.8)\n        yield c\n\nREGISTRY.register(CustomCollector())\n```\n\n`SummaryMetricFamily`, `HistogramMetricFamily` and `InfoMetricFamily` work similarly.\n\nA collector may implement a `describe` method which returns metrics in the same\nformat as `collect` (though you don't have to include the samples). This is\nused to predetermine the names of time series a `CollectorRegistry` exposes and\nthus to detect collisions and duplicate registrations.\n\nUsually custom collectors do not have to implement `describe`. If `describe` is\nnot implemented and the CollectorRegistry was created with `auto_describe=True`\n(which is the case for the default registry) then `collect` will be called at\nregistration time instead of `describe`. If this could cause problems, either\nimplement a proper `describe`, or if that's not practical have `describe`\nreturn an empty list.\n\n\n## Multiprocess Mode (E.g. Gunicorn)\n\nPrometheus client libraries presume a threaded model, where metrics are shared\nacross workers. This doesn't work so well for languages such as Python where\nit's common to have processes rather than threads to handle large workloads.\n\nTo handle this the client library can be put in multiprocess mode.\nThis comes with a number of limitations:\n\n- Registries can not be used as normal, all instantiated metrics are exported\n  - Registering metrics to a registry later used by a `MultiProcessCollector`\n    may cause duplicate metrics to be exported\n- Custom collectors do not work (e.g. cpu and memory metrics)\n- Info and Enum metrics do not work\n- The pushgateway cannot be used\n- Gauges cannot use the `pid` label\n- Exemplars are not supported\n\nThere's several steps to getting this working:\n\n**1. Deployment**:\n\nThe `PROMETHEUS_MULTIPROC_DIR` environment variable must be set to a directory\nthat the client library can use for metrics. This directory must be wiped\nbetween process/Gunicorn runs (before startup is recommended).\n\nThis environment variable should be set from a start-up shell script,\nand not directly from Python (otherwise it may not propagate to child processes).\n\n**2. Metrics collector**:\n\nThe application must initialize a new `CollectorRegistry`, and store the\nmulti-process collector inside. It is a best practice to create this registry\ninside the context of a request to avoid metrics registering themselves to a\ncollector used by a `MultiProcessCollector`. If a registry with metrics\nregistered is used by a `MultiProcessCollector` duplicate metrics may be\nexported, one for multiprocess, and one for the process serving the request.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import multiprocess\nfrom prometheus_client import generate_latest, CollectorRegistry, CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST, Counter\n\nMY_COUNTER = Counter('my_counter', 'Description of my counter')\n\n# Expose metrics.\ndef app(environ, start_response):\n    registry = CollectorRegistry()\n    multiprocess.MultiProcessCollector(registry)\n    data = generate_latest(registry)\n    status = '200 OK'\n    response_headers = [\n        ('Content-type', CONTENT_TYPE_LATEST),\n        ('Content-Length', str(len(data)))\n    ]\n    start_response(status, response_headers)\n    return iter([data])\n```\n\n**3. Gunicorn configuration**:\n\nThe `gunicorn` configuration file needs to include the following function:\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import multiprocess\n\ndef child_exit(server, worker):\n    multiprocess.mark_process_dead(worker.pid)\n```\n\n**4. Metrics tuning (Gauge)**:\n\nWhen `Gauge`s are used in multiprocess applications,\nyou must decide how to handle the metrics reported by each process.\nGauges have several modes they can run in, which can be selected with the `multiprocess_mode` parameter.\n\n- 'all': Default. Return a timeseries per process (alive or dead), labelled by the process's `pid` (the label is added internally).\n- 'min': Return a single timeseries that is the minimum of the values of all processes (alive or dead).\n- 'max': Return a single timeseries that is the maximum of the values of all processes (alive or dead).\n- 'sum': Return a single timeseries that is the sum of the values of all processes (alive or dead).\n\nPrepend 'live' to the beginning of the mode to return the same result but only considering living processes\n(e.g., 'liveall, 'livesum', 'livemax', 'livemin').\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client import Gauge\n\n# Example gauge\nIN_PROGRESS = Gauge(\"inprogress_requests\", \"help\", multiprocess_mode='livesum')\n```\n\n\n## Parser\n\nThe Python client supports parsing the Prometheus text format.\nThis is intended for advanced use cases where you have servers\nexposing Prometheus metrics and need to get them into some other\nsystem.\n\n```python\nfrom prometheus_client.parser import text_string_to_metric_families\nfor family in text_string_to_metric_families(u\"my_gauge 1.0\\n\"):\n  for sample in family.samples:\n    print(\"Name: {0} Labels: {1} Value: {2}\".format(*sample))\n```\n\n## Links\n\n* [Releases](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python/releases): The releases page shows the history of the project and acts as a changelog.\n* [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/prometheus_client)\n",

      "description": "Pyrsistent\n==========\n.. image:: https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent/actions/workflows/tests.yaml\n\n\n.. _Pyrthon: https://www.github.com/tobgu/pyrthon\n.. _Pyrsistent_extras: https://github.com/mingmingrr/pyrsistent-extras\n\nPyrsistent is a number of persistent collections (by some referred to as functional data structures). Persistent in\nthe sense that they are immutable.\n\nAll methods on a data structure that would normally mutate it instead return a new copy of the structure containing the\nrequested updates. The original structure is left untouched.\n\nThis will simplify the reasoning about what a program does since no hidden side effects ever can take place to these\ndata structures. You can rest assured that the object you hold a reference to will remain the same throughout its\nlifetime and need not worry that somewhere five stack levels below you in the darkest corner of your application\nsomeone has decided to remove that element that you expected to be there.\n\nPyrsistent is influenced by persistent data structures such as those found in the standard library of Clojure. The\ndata structures are designed to share common elements through path copying.\nIt aims at taking these concepts and make them as pythonic as possible so that they can be easily integrated into any python\nprogram without hassle.\n\nIf you want use literal syntax to define them in your code rather\nthan function calls check out Pyrthon_. Be aware, that one is experimental, unmaintained and alpha software. \n\nIf you cannot find the persistent data structure you're looking for here you may want to take a look at\nPyrsistent_extras_ which is maintained by @mingmingrr. If you still don't find what you're looking for please\nopen an issue for discussion. If we agree that functionality is missing you may want to go ahead and create\na Pull Request implement the missing functionality.\n\nExamples\n--------\n.. _Sequence: collections_\n.. _Hashable: collections_\n.. _Mapping: collections_\n.. _Mappings: collections_\n.. _Set: collections_\n.. _collections: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html\n.. _documentation: http://pyrsistent.readthedocs.org/\n\nThe collection types and key features currently implemented are:\n\n* PVector_, similar to a python list\n* PMap_, similar to dict\n* PSet_, similar to set\n* PRecord_, a PMap on steroids with fixed fields, optional type and invariant checking and much more\n* PClass_, a Python class fixed fields, optional type and invariant checking and much more\n* `Checked collections`_, PVector, PMap and PSet with optional type and invariance checks and more\n* PBag, similar to collections.Counter\n* PList, a classic singly linked list\n* PDeque, similar to collections.deque\n* Immutable object type (immutable) built on the named tuple\n* freeze_ and thaw_ functions to convert between pythons standard collections and pyrsistent collections.\n* Flexible transformations_ of arbitrarily complex structures built from PMaps and PVectors.\n\nBelow are examples of common usage patterns for some of the structures and features. More information and\nfull documentation for all data structures is available in the documentation_.\n\n.. _PVector:\n\nPVector\n~~~~~~~\nWith full support for the Sequence_ protocol PVector is meant as a drop in replacement to the built in list from a readers\npoint of view. Write operations of course differ since no in place mutation is done but naming should be in line\nwith corresponding operations on the built in list.\n\nSupport for the Hashable_ protocol also means that it can be used as key in Mappings_.\n\nAppends are amortized O(1). Random access and insert is log32(n) where n is the size of the vector.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import v, pvector\n\n    # No mutation of vectors once created, instead they\n    # are \"evolved\" leaving the original untouched\n    >>> v1 = v(1, 2, 3)\n    >>> v2 = v1.append(4)\n    >>> v3 = v2.set(1, 5)\n    >>> v1\n    pvector([1, 2, 3])\n    >>> v2\n    pvector([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    >>> v3\n    pvector([1, 5, 3, 4])\n\n    # Random access and slicing\n    >>> v3[1]\n    5\n    >>> v3[1:3]\n    pvector([5, 3])\n\n    # Iteration\n    >>> list(x + 1 for x in v3)\n    [2, 6, 4, 5]\n    >>> pvector(2 * x for x in range(3))\n    pvector([0, 2, 4])\n\n.. _PMap:\n\nPMap\n~~~~\nWith full support for the Mapping_ protocol PMap is meant as a drop in replacement to the built in dict from a readers point\nof view. Support for the Hashable_ protocol also means that it can be used as key in other Mappings_.\n\nRandom access and insert is log32(n) where n is the size of the map.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import m, pmap, v\n\n    # No mutation of maps once created, instead they are\n    # \"evolved\" leaving the original untouched\n    >>> m1 = m(a=1, b=2)\n    >>> m2 = m1.set('c', 3)\n    >>> m3 = m2.set('a', 5)\n    >>> m1\n    pmap({'a': 1, 'b': 2})\n    >>> m2\n    pmap({'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2})\n    >>> m3\n    pmap({'a': 5, 'c': 3, 'b': 2})\n    >>> m3['a']\n    5\n\n    # Evolution of nested persistent structures\n    >>> m4 = m(a=5, b=6, c=v(1, 2))\n    >>> m4.transform(('c', 1), 17)\n    pmap({'a': 5, 'c': pvector([1, 17]), 'b': 6})\n    >>> m5 = m(a=1, b=2)\n\n    # Evolve by merging with other mappings\n    >>> m5.update(m(a=2, c=3), {'a': 17, 'd': 35})\n    pmap({'a': 17, 'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'd': 35})\n    >>> pmap({'x': 1, 'y': 2}) + pmap({'y': 3, 'z': 4})\n    pmap({'y': 3, 'x': 1, 'z': 4})\n\n    # Dict-like methods to convert to list and iterate\n    >>> m3.items()\n    pvector([('a', 5), ('c', 3), ('b', 2)])\n    >>> list(m3)\n    ['a', 'c', 'b']\n\n.. _PSet:\n\nPSet\n~~~~\nWith full support for the Set_ protocol PSet is meant as a drop in replacement to the built in set from a readers point\nof view. Support for the Hashable_ protocol also means that it can be used as key in Mappings_.\n\nRandom access and insert is log32(n) where n is the size of the set.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import s\n\n    # No mutation of sets once created, you know the story...\n    >>> s1 = s(1, 2, 3, 2)\n    >>> s2 = s1.add(4)\n    >>> s3 = s1.remove(1)\n    >>> s1\n    pset([1, 2, 3])\n    >>> s2\n    pset([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    >>> s3\n    pset([2, 3])\n\n    # Full support for set operations\n    >>> s1 | s(3, 4, 5)\n    pset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n    >>> s1 & s(3, 4, 5)\n    pset([3])\n    >>> s1 < s2\n    True\n    >>> s1 < s(3, 4, 5)\n    False\n\n.. _PRecord:\n\nPRecord\n~~~~~~~\nA PRecord is a PMap with a fixed set of specified fields. Records are declared as python classes inheriting\nfrom PRecord. Because it is a PMap it has full support for all Mapping methods such as iteration and element\naccess using subscript notation.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import PRecord, field\n    >>> class ARecord(PRecord):\n    ...     x = field()\n    ...\n    >>> r = ARecord(x=3)\n    >>> r\n    ARecord(x=3)\n    >>> r.x\n    3\n    >>> r.set(x=2)\n    ARecord(x=2)\n    >>> r.set(y=2)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    AttributeError: 'y' is not among the specified fields for ARecord\n\nType information\n****************\nIt is possible to add type information to the record to enforce type checks. Multiple allowed types can be specified\nby providing an iterable of types.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> class BRecord(PRecord):\n    ...     x = field(type=int)\n    ...     y = field(type=(int, type(None)))\n    ...\n    >>> BRecord(x=3, y=None)\n    BRecord(y=None, x=3)\n    >>> BRecord(x=3.0)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    PTypeError: Invalid type for field BRecord.x, was float\n\n\nCustom types (classes) that are iterable should be wrapped in a tuple to prevent their\nmembers being added to the set of valid types.  Although Enums in particular are now\nsupported without wrapping, see #83 for more information.\n\nMandatory fields\n****************\nFields are not mandatory by default but can be specified as such. If fields are missing an\n*InvariantException* will be thrown which contains information about the missing fields.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import InvariantException\n    >>> class CRecord(PRecord):\n    ...     x = field(mandatory=True)\n    ...\n    >>> r = CRecord(x=3)\n    >>> try:\n    ...    r.discard('x')\n    ... except InvariantException as e:\n    ...    print(e.missing_fields)\n    ...\n    ('CRecord.x',)\n\nInvariants\n**********\nIt is possible to add invariants that must hold when evolving the record. Invariants can be\nspecified on both field and record level. If invariants fail an *InvariantException* will be\nthrown which contains information about the failing invariants. An invariant function should\nreturn a tuple consisting of a boolean that tells if the invariant holds or not and an object\ndescribing the invariant. This object can later be used to identify which invariant that failed.\n\nThe global invariant function is only executed if all field invariants hold.\n\nGlobal invariants are inherited to subclasses.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> class RestrictedVector(PRecord):\n    ...     __invariant__ = lambda r: (r.y >= r.x, 'x larger than y')\n    ...     x = field(invariant=lambda x: (x > 0, 'x negative'))\n    ...     y = field(invariant=lambda y: (y > 0, 'y negative'))\n    ...\n    >>> r = RestrictedVector(y=3, x=2)\n    >>> try:\n    ...    r.set(x=-1, y=-2)\n    ... except InvariantException as e:\n    ...    print(e.invariant_errors)\n    ...\n    ('y negative', 'x negative')\n    >>> try:\n    ...    r.set(x=2, y=1)\n    ... except InvariantException as e:\n    ...    print(e.invariant_errors)\n    ...\n    ('x larger than y',)\n\nInvariants may also contain multiple assertions. For those cases the invariant function should\nreturn a tuple of invariant tuples as described above. This structure is reflected in the\ninvariant_errors attribute of the exception which will contain tuples with data from all failed\ninvariants. Eg:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> class EvenX(PRecord):\n    ...     x = field(invariant=lambda x: ((x > 0, 'x negative'), (x % 2 == 0, 'x odd')))\n    ...\n    >>> try:\n    ...    EvenX(x=-1)\n    ... except InvariantException as e:\n    ...    print(e.invariant_errors)\n    ...\n    (('x negative', 'x odd'),)\n\n\nFactories\n*********\nIt's possible to specify factory functions for fields. The factory function receives whatever\nis supplied as field value and the actual returned by the factory is assigned to the field\ngiven that any type and invariant checks hold.\nPRecords have a default factory specified as a static function on the class, create(). It takes\na *Mapping* as argument and returns an instance of the specific record.\nIf a record has fields of type PRecord the create() method of that record will\nbe called to create the \"sub record\" if no factory has explicitly been specified to override\nthis behaviour.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> class DRecord(PRecord):\n    ...     x = field(factory=int)\n    ...\n    >>> class ERecord(PRecord):\n    ...     d = field(type=DRecord)\n    ...\n    >>> ERecord.create({'d': {'x': '1'}})\n    ERecord(d=DRecord(x=1))\n\nCollection fields\n*****************\nIt is also possible to have fields with ``pyrsistent`` collections.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   >>> from pyrsistent import pset_field, pmap_field, pvector_field\n   >>> class MultiRecord(PRecord):\n   ...     set_of_ints = pset_field(int)\n   ...     map_int_to_str = pmap_field(int, str)\n   ...     vector_of_strs = pvector_field(str)\n   ...\n\nSerialization\n*************\nPRecords support serialization back to dicts. Default serialization will take keys and values\n\"as is\" and output them into a dict. It is possible to specify custom serialization functions\nto take care of fields that require special treatment.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from datetime import date\n    >>> class Person(PRecord):\n    ...     name = field(type=unicode)\n    ...     birth_date = field(type=date,\n    ...                        serializer=lambda format, d: d.strftime(format['date']))\n    ...\n    >>> john = Person(name=u'John', birth_date=date(1985, 10, 21))\n    >>> john.serialize({'date': '%Y-%m-%d'})\n    {'birth_date': '1985-10-21', 'name': u'John'}\n\n\n.. _instar: https://github.com/boxed/instar/\n\n.. _PClass:\n\nPClass\n~~~~~~\nA PClass is a python class with a fixed set of specified fields. PClasses are declared as python classes inheriting\nfrom PClass. It is defined the same way that PRecords are and behaves like a PRecord in all aspects except that it\nis not a PMap and hence not a collection but rather a plain Python object.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import PClass, field\n    >>> class AClass(PClass):\n    ...     x = field()\n    ...\n    >>> a = AClass(x=3)\n    >>> a\n    AClass(x=3)\n    >>> a.x\n    3\n\n\nChecked collections\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nChecked collections currently come in three flavors: CheckedPVector, CheckedPMap and CheckedPSet.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import CheckedPVector, CheckedPMap, CheckedPSet, thaw\n    >>> class Positives(CheckedPSet):\n    ...     __type__ = (long, int)\n    ...     __invariant__ = lambda n: (n >= 0, 'Negative')\n    ...\n    >>> class Lottery(PRecord):\n    ...     name = field(type=str)\n    ...     numbers = field(type=Positives, invariant=lambda p: (len(p) > 0, 'No numbers'))\n    ...\n    >>> class Lotteries(CheckedPVector):\n    ...     __type__ = Lottery\n    ...\n    >>> class LotteriesByDate(CheckedPMap):\n    ...     __key_type__ = date\n    ...     __value_type__ = Lotteries\n    ...\n    >>> lotteries = LotteriesByDate.create({date(2015, 2, 15): [{'name': 'SuperLotto', 'numbers': {1, 2, 3}},\n    ...                                                         {'name': 'MegaLotto',  'numbers': {4, 5, 6}}],\n    ...                                     date(2015, 2, 16): [{'name': 'SuperLotto', 'numbers': {3, 2, 1}},\n    ...                                                         {'name': 'MegaLotto',  'numbers': {6, 5, 4}}]})\n    >>> lotteries\n    LotteriesByDate({datetime.date(2015, 2, 15): Lotteries([Lottery(numbers=Positives([1, 2, 3]), name='SuperLotto'), Lottery(numbers=Positives([4, 5, 6]), name='MegaLotto')]), datetime.date(2015, 2, 16): Lotteries([Lottery(numbers=Positives([1, 2, 3]), name='SuperLotto'), Lottery(numbers=Positives([4, 5, 6]), name='MegaLotto')])})\n\n    # The checked versions support all operations that the corresponding\n    # unchecked types do\n    >>> lottery_0215 = lotteries[date(2015, 2, 15)]\n    >>> lottery_0215.transform([0, 'name'], 'SuperDuperLotto')\n    Lotteries([Lottery(numbers=Positives([1, 2, 3]), name='SuperDuperLotto'), Lottery(numbers=Positives([4, 5, 6]), name='MegaLotto')])\n\n    # But also makes asserts that types and invariants hold\n    >>> lottery_0215.transform([0, 'name'], 999)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    PTypeError: Invalid type for field Lottery.name, was int\n\n    >>> lottery_0215.transform([0, 'numbers'], set())\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    InvariantException: Field invariant failed\n\n    # They can be converted back to python built ins with either thaw()\n    # or serialize() (which provides possibilities to customize serialization)\n    >>> thaw(lottery_0215)\n    [{'numbers': set([1, 2, 3]), 'name': 'SuperLotto'}, {'numbers': set([4, 5, 6]), 'name': 'MegaLotto'}]\n    >>> lottery_0215.serialize()\n    [{'numbers': set([1, 2, 3]), 'name': 'SuperLotto'}, {'numbers': set([4, 5, 6]), 'name': 'MegaLotto'}]\n\n.. _transformations:\n\nTransformations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTransformations are inspired by the cool library instar_ for Clojure. They let you evolve PMaps and PVectors\nwith arbitrarily deep/complex nesting using simple syntax and flexible matching syntax.\n\nThe first argument to transformation is the path that points out the value to transform. The\nsecond is the transformation to perform. If the transformation is callable it will be applied\nto the value(s) matching the path. The path may also contain callables. In that case they are\ntreated as matchers. If the matcher returns True for a specific key it is considered for transformation.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # Basic examples\n    >>> from pyrsistent import inc, freeze, thaw, rex, ny, discard\n    >>> v1 = freeze([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n    >>> v1.transform([2], inc)\n    pvector([1, 2, 4, 4, 5])\n    >>> v1.transform([lambda ix: 0 < ix < 4], 8)\n    pvector([1, 8, 8, 8, 5])\n    >>> v1.transform([lambda ix, v: ix == 0 or v == 5], 0)\n    pvector([0, 2, 3, 4, 0])\n\n    # The (a)ny matcher can be used to match anything\n    >>> v1.transform([ny], 8)\n    pvector([8, 8, 8, 8, 8])\n\n    # Regular expressions can be used for matching\n    >>> scores = freeze({'John': 12, 'Joseph': 34, 'Sara': 23})\n    >>> scores.transform([rex('^Jo')], 0)\n    pmap({'Joseph': 0, 'Sara': 23, 'John': 0})\n\n    # Transformations can be done on arbitrarily deep structures\n    >>> news_paper = freeze({'articles': [{'author': 'Sara', 'content': 'A short article'},\n    ...                                   {'author': 'Steve', 'content': 'A slightly longer article'}],\n    ...                      'weather': {'temperature': '11C', 'wind': '5m/s'}})\n    >>> short_news = news_paper.transform(['articles', ny, 'content'], lambda c: c[:25] + '...' if len(c) > 25 else c)\n    >>> very_short_news = news_paper.transform(['articles', ny, 'content'], lambda c: c[:15] + '...' if len(c) > 15 else c)\n    >>> very_short_news.articles[0].content\n    'A short article'\n    >>> very_short_news.articles[1].content\n    'A slightly long...'\n\n    # When nothing has been transformed the original data structure is kept\n    >>> short_news is news_paper\n    True\n    >>> very_short_news is news_paper\n    False\n    >>> very_short_news.articles[0] is news_paper.articles[0]\n    True\n\n    # There is a special transformation that can be used to discard elements. Also\n    # multiple transformations can be applied in one call\n    >>> thaw(news_paper.transform(['weather'], discard, ['articles', ny, 'content'], discard))\n    {'articles': [{'author': 'Sara'}, {'author': 'Steve'}]}\n\nEvolvers\n~~~~~~~~\nPVector, PMap and PSet all have support for a concept dubbed *evolvers*. An evolver acts like a mutable\nview of the underlying persistent data structure with \"transaction like\" semantics. No updates of the original\ndata structure is ever performed, it is still fully immutable.\n\nThe evolvers have a very limited API by design to discourage excessive, and inappropriate, usage as that would\ntake us down the mutable road. In principle only basic mutation and element access functions are supported.\nCheck out the documentation_ of each data structure for specific examples.\n\nExamples of when you may want to use an evolver instead of working directly with the data structure include:\n\n* Multiple updates are done to the same data structure and the intermediate results are of no\n  interest. In this case using an evolver may be a more efficient and easier to work with.\n* You need to pass a vector into a legacy function or a function that you have no control\n  over which performs in place mutations. In this case pass an evolver instance\n  instead and then create a new pvector from the evolver once the function returns.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import v\n\n    # In place mutation as when working with the built in counterpart\n    >>> v1 = v(1, 2, 3)\n    >>> e = v1.evolver()\n    >>> e[1] = 22\n    >>> e = e.append(4)\n    >>> e = e.extend([5, 6])\n    >>> e[5] += 1\n    >>> len(e)\n    6\n\n    # The evolver is considered *dirty* when it contains changes compared to the underlying vector\n    >>> e.is_dirty()\n    True\n\n    # But the underlying pvector still remains untouched\n    >>> v1\n    pvector([1, 2, 3])\n\n    # Once satisfied with the updates you can produce a new pvector containing the updates.\n    # The new pvector will share data with the original pvector in the same way that would have\n    # been done if only using operations on the pvector.\n    >>> v2 = e.persistent()\n    >>> v2\n    pvector([1, 22, 3, 4, 5, 7])\n\n    # The evolver is now no longer considered *dirty* as it contains no differences compared to the\n    # pvector just produced.\n    >>> e.is_dirty()\n    False\n\n    # You may continue to work with the same evolver without affecting the content of v2\n    >>> e[0] = 11\n\n    # Or create a new evolver from v2. The two evolvers can be updated independently but will both\n    # share data with v2 where possible.\n    >>> e2 = v2.evolver()\n    >>> e2[0] = 1111\n    >>> e.persistent()\n    pvector([11, 22, 3, 4, 5, 7])\n    >>> e2.persistent()\n    pvector([1111, 22, 3, 4, 5, 7])\n\n.. _freeze:\n.. _thaw:\n\nfreeze and thaw\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThese functions are great when your cozy immutable world has to interact with the evil mutable world outside.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import freeze, thaw, v, m\n    >>> freeze([1, {'a': 3}])\n    pvector([1, pmap({'a': 3})])\n    >>> thaw(v(1, m(a=3)))\n    [1, {'a': 3}]\n\nBy default, freeze will also recursively convert values inside PVectors and PMaps. This behaviour can be changed by providing freeze with the flag strict=False.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    >>> from pyrsistent import freeze, v, m\n    >>> freeze(v(1, v(2, [3])))\n    pvector([1, pvector([2, pvector([3])])])\n    >>> freeze(v(1, v(2, [3])), strict=False)\n    pvector([1, pvector([2, [3]])])\n    >>> freeze(m(a=m(b={'c': 1})))\n    pmap({'a': pmap({'b': pmap({'c': 1})})})\n    >>> freeze(m(a=m(b={'c': 1})), strict=False)\n    pmap({'a': pmap({'b': {'c': 1}})})\n\nIn this regard, thaw operates as the inverse of freeze so will thaw values inside native data structures unless passed the strict=False flag.\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nPyrsistent is developed and tested on Python 3.7+ and PyPy3.\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nPyrsistent is developed with performance in mind. Still, while some operations are nearly on par with their built in,\nmutable, counterparts in terms of speed, other operations are slower. In the cases where attempts at\noptimizations have been done, speed has generally been valued over space.\n\nPyrsistent comes with two API compatible flavors of PVector (on which PMap and PSet are based), one pure Python\nimplementation and one implemented as a C extension. The latter generally being 2 - 20 times faster than the former.\nThe C extension will be used automatically when possible.\n\nThe pure python implementation is fully PyPy compatible. Running it under PyPy speeds operations up considerably if\nthe structures are used heavily (if JITed), for some cases the performance is almost on par with the built in counterparts.\n\nType hints\n----------\n\nPEP 561 style type hints for use with mypy and various editors are available for most types and functions in pyrsistent.\n\nType classes for annotating your own code with pyrsistent types are also available under pyrsistent.typing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\npip install pyrsistent\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nAvailable at http://pyrsistent.readthedocs.org/\n\nBrief presentation available at http://slides.com/tobiasgustafsson/immutability-and-python/\n\nContributors\n------------\n\nTobias Gustafsson https://github.com/tobgu\n\nChristopher Armstrong https://github.com/radix\n\nAnders Hovmöller https://github.com/boxed\n\nItamar Turner-Trauring https://github.com/itamarst\n\nJonathan Lange https://github.com/jml\n\nRichard Futrell https://github.com/Futrell\n\nJakob Hollenstein https://github.com/jkbjh\n\nDavid Honour https://github.com/foolswood\n\nDavid R.

You may certainly put your trust in this code.\n\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/requests/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/requests)\n[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests)\n[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/psf/requests.svg)](https://github.com/psf/requests/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Installing Requests and Supported Versions\n\nRequests is available on PyPI:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip install requests\n```\n\nRequests officially supports Python 3.7+.\n\n## Supported Features & Best–Practices\n\nRequests is ready for the demands of building robust and reliable HTTP–speaking applications, for the needs of today.\n\n- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n- International Domains and URLs\n- Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n- Browser-style TLS/SSL Verification\n- Basic & Digest Authentication\n- Familiar `dict`–like Cookies\n- Automatic Content Decompression and Decoding\n- Multi-part File Uploads\n- SOCKS Proxy Support\n- Connection Timeouts\n- Streaming Downloads\n- Automatic honoring of `.netrc`\n- Chunked HTTP Requests\n\n## API Reference and User Guide available on [Read the Docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n[![Read the Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/ss.png)](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n## Cloning the repository\n\nWhen cloning the Requests repository, you may need to add the `-c\nfetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad commit (see\n[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more background):\n\n```shell\ngit clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/psf/requests.git\n```\n\nYou can also apply this setting to your global Git config:\n\n```shell\ngit config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore\n```\n\n---\n\n[![Kenneth Reitz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/kr.png)](https://kennethreitz.org) [![Python Software Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/psf.png)](https://www.python.org/psf)\n\n\n",

Grants\n      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and\n         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.\n      2.2. Effective Date\n      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.\n      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or\n         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.\n      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n      2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n      2.5. Representation\n      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n      2.6. Fair Use\n      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n      2.7. Conditions\n      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n   3. Responsibilities\n      3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.\n      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n      3.4. Notices\n      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n      3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.\n   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n   5. Termination\n      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.\n   6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.\n   7. Limitation of Liability\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n   8. Litigation\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n   9. Miscellaneous\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n   10. Versions of the License\n      10.1. New Versions\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n      10.2. Effect of New Versions\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.\n      10.3. Modified Versions\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).\n      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.",

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.",

Much of the\nPython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.\nurllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python\nstandard libraries:\n\n- Thread safety.\n- Connection pooling.\n- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.\n- File uploads with multipart encoding.\n- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.\n- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.\n- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.\n- 100% test coverage.\n\nurllib3 is powerful and easy to use:\n\n```python3\n>>> import urllib3\n>>> resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"http://httpbin.org/robots.txt\")\n>>> resp.status\n200\n>>> resp.data\nb\"User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n\"\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nurllib3 can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install urllib3\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the latest source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3):\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git\n$ cd urllib3\n$ pip install .\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nurllib3 has usage and reference documentation at [urllib3.readthedocs.io](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io).\n\n\n## Community\n\nurllib3 has a [community Discord channel](https://discord.gg/urllib3) for asking questions and\ncollaborating with other contributors. Drop by and say hello 👋\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nurllib3 happily accepts contributions. Please see our\n[contributing documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)\nfor some tips on getting started.\n\n\n## Security Disclosures\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\nTidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with maintainers.\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@sethmlarson](https://github.com/sethmlarson) (Seth M.

      "description": "Werkzeug\n========\n\n*werkzeug* German noun: \"tool\". Etymology: *werk* (\"work\"), *zeug* (\"stuff\")\n\nWerkzeug is a comprehensive `WSGI`_ web application library. It began as\na simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has\nbecome one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and\n    source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any\n    frame in the stack.\n-   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with\n    headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.\n-   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle\n    streaming data.\n-   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs\n    for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables\n    from URLs.\n-   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user\n    agents, cookies, files, and more.\n-   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications\n    locally.\n-   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without\n    requiring running a server.\n\nWerkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to\nchoose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle\nrequests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications\nsuch as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.\n\n`Flask`_ wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while\nproviding more structure and patterns for defining powerful\napplications.\n\n.. _WSGI: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n.. _Flask: https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\n\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nInstall and update using `pip`_:\n\n.. code-block:: text\n\n    pip install -U Werkzeug\n\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/\n\n\nA Simple Example\n----------------\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from werkzeug.wrappers import Request, Response\n\n    @Request.application\n    def application(request):\n        return Response('Hello, World!')\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        from werkzeug.serving import run_simple\n        run_simple('localhost', 4000, application)\n\n\nDonate\n------\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Werkzeug and other\npopular packages.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n      c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n      d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.

In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.

This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.\n      e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work.

For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses.

Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n      f.

The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions.

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work.

If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\n      b.

A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n      b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n      c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n      d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n      e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\n      f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n   2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n      b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n      c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n      d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\n      e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n         ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n      f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.\n      b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n      e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.",

Definitions\n      a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n      a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n      b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n         iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n      a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n      b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n      c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   7. Termination\n      a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n      b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n   8. Miscellaneous\n      a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n      c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n      d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.\n      e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n      f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:\n      a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.\n      d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n      c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)\n   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n   7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   \n   NO WARRANTY 9.\n   BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nAppendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) 19yy <name of author>\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here a sample; alter the names:\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes at assemblers) written by James Hacker.\n<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice\nThat's all there is to it!",
    "GPL-2.0-only": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 , USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n   NO WARRANTY\n   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    "GPL-3.0-only": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0. Definitions.\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.",
    "GPL-3.0-or-later": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n   0. Definitions.\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n   1. Source Code.\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n   2. Basic Permissions.\n   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\".\n      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\n      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\n   A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n   \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\n   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n   7. Additional Terms.\n   \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\n      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n   8. Termination.\n   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n   An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n   11. Patents.\n   A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n   A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n   In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n   A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n   14. Revised Versions of this License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n   16. Limitation of Liability.\n   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.",
    "GPL-3.0-with-GCC-exception": "﻿insert GPL v3 text here GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION\nVersion 3.1, 31 March 2009\nGeneral information: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception.html\nCopyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n   0. Definitions.\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.",

Additional Definitions.\n      \n      As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n      \n      \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n      \n      An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n      \n      A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked Version\".\n      \n      The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n      \n      The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n   2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n   4. Combined Works.\n   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n      d) Do one of the following:\n         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n   5. Combined Libraries.\n   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.",
